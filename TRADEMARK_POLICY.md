# TSera Trademark Policy

_Last updated: 2026-02-16_

The **TSera** name and logo (the **“Marks”**) identify the open-source TSera project and its
community. This policy explains when and how you may use the Marks. It does **not** grant any rights
to the TSera source code; the code is licensed separately under **Apache-2.0**.

**Owner.** The Marks are owned by **Aurélien Altarriba** (the “Owner”). If ownership transfers to a
corporate entity (e.g., Altarriba SAS), this policy will be updated accordingly.

## What this policy covers

- The word marks **TSera**, **TSERA**, and related stylizations.
- The TSera **logo(s)**, icons, and lockups.
- Confusingly similar variations.

## Permitted uses _without_ asking for permission

You may use the Marks in plain text to **truthfully refer to the project**, provided you do not
imply endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship.

You may use the official **“Built with TSera”** badge (unmodified) to indicate compatibility, per
the Permitted uses section.

**Examples (allowed):**

- “Built with **TSera**.” / “Powered by **TSera**.”
- “Plugin for **TSera**” / “Compatible with **TSera**.” (must be accurate)
- Books, tutorials, talks, blog posts, academic references (“Using TSera with Deno”).
- Community groups: “**TSera Community Paris**” — non-commercial, volunteer-run, with a disclaimer:
  _“This is an independent community and not affiliated with or endorsed by the TSera project.”_

> **Attribution (recommended):** Include: _“TSera is a trademark of Altarriba.”_

## Uses that **require permission** (ask first)

Email [brand@tsera.dev](mailto:brand@tsera.dev) with details (see _Requesting permission_ below) if
you intend to:

- Use the Marks in a **product or service name**, e.g., “TSera Hosting”, “TSera Cloud”, “TSera Pro”.
- Register or use a **domain name** containing “tsera” or confusingly similar strings (e.g.,
  `tsera-hosting.example`).
- Use the **logo** or any modified/combined version of it (including app icons, lockups, or
  merchandise).
- Use the Marks as part of a **company/organization name**.
- Create **events** where TSera is the primary brand (e.g., “TSeraConf”).

> As a rule of thumb, prefer constructions like **“for TSera”** (e.g., “Hosting for TSera”) rather
> than “TSera Hosting”.

## Prohibited uses

These are **not allowed** under any circumstance:

- Misleading users into thinking your project, product, or company is **official**, **certified**,
  or **endorsed** by TSera.
- Altering, distorting, or combining the **logo** with other elements; creating look-alike logos.
- Using the Marks on **merchandise** (stickers, tees, mugs) without permission.
- Prominent branding of **modified forks** as “TSera” (see Forks below).
- Do not register or use domains containing “tsera” (e.g., `tsera-cloud.*`) without permission.
- Do not publish under `@tsera/*` (npm/jsr/deno) without permission. Prefer `@your-scope/tsera-...`
  or `tsera-...`.

## Reservation of rights

Except for the permissions expressly granted in this Policy, **all rights are reserved**. Permission
may be revoked at any time if a use is misleading, non-compliant, or harmful to the TSera community.

## Trademark symbols

Use **TSera™** until registration is completed; after registration, use **TSera®** where
appropriate. Do not add these symbols to your own product names.

## Visual guidelines (summary)

- Use the capitalization **TSera** (not “Tsera”, “TSERA”, etc.) in text.
- Do **not** modify the logo’s aspect ratio, colors, or clear space.
- Do **not** place the logo on busy backgrounds that reduce legibility.
- Do **not** combine the logo with other logos or words into a single mark without permission.

(A full brand guide may be published later; until then, use common-sense clarity.)

## Forks, distributions, and compatibility

- **Unmodified distributions** of TSera may state that they contain or bundle “TSera” and may link
  to the official project repository.

- **Modified forks** must use a **different name and logo**. Modified forks must not use confusingly
  similar names such as “TSeraX”, “TSera Plus”, or “TSera Pro”. Use a distinct name and logo, and
  describe it as “a fork of TSera” only in descriptive text.

- The README of any modified fork must prominently display at the top: _“This is an unofficial fork
  of TSera and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the TSera project.”_

- **Compatibility claims** (e.g., “compatible with TSera”) must be accurate and not suggest
  endorsement. If compatibility is partial or limited, say so.

## Requesting permission

Email [brand@tsera.dev](mailto:brand@tsera.dev) with:

- Your name and organization
- The specific Mark(s) you want to use (word mark, logo)
- Purpose and context (product, service, event, article, domain name)
- Geographic scope and duration
- Visuals/mockups of the intended use
- Your contact information and timeline

We aim to review requests pragmatically and respond in a reasonable time frame. Approval may include
conditions (e.g., specific attribution or design constraints).

## Reporting misuse

If you suspect misuse or confusing use of the Marks, contact
[brand@tsera.dev](mailto:brand@tsera.dev) or [conduct@tsera.dev](mailto:conduct@tsera.dev) (for
behavior issues). We may take action at our discretion to protect the Marks and the community.

## Relationship to open-source licensing

This policy governs **trademark** use only. It does not affect the permissions granted by the
**Apache-2.0** license for the TSera source code. Code may be copied, modified, and redistributed
under Apache-2.0, but the Marks cannot be used in ways restricted by this policy.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced on the project
website, Discord or GitHub repository.

_This policy is not legal advice. For questions about specific uses, contact
[brand@tsera.dev](mailto:brand@tsera.dev)._
