# TSera documentation hub

Welcome to the documentation index. Each guide focuses on a specific aspect of TSera so developers
can quickly find the information they need.

## Start here

- [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) — install the CLI, bootstrap a project, and run your first
  coherence cycle.
- [Task-oriented recipes](./RECIPES.md) — follow concise workflows to add entities, regenerate
  artifacts, or fix drift.
- [CLI command reference](./CLI_REFERENCE.md) — dive into every option supported by the four core
  commands (`init`, `dev`, `doctor`, `update`).

## Deep dives

- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — understand the DAG, planner, applier, and watcher internals.
- [Communication playbook](./COMMUNICATION.md) — messaging, channels, and launch guidance.

## How to contribute to the docs

- Keep guides practical and reproducible: every command should work in a fresh checkout.
- Reference the relevant recipe or command section when adding new features.
- When adding screenshots or code samples, prefer short snippets and highlight the expected output.

If you spot gaps or want to propose a new section, open an issue describing the scenario you want to
document.
