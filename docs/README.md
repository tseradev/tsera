# TSera documentation (placeholder)

This folder gathers TSera's public guides. The documentation will progressively detail the vision,
CLI workflows, and generated artifacts (entities, schemas, migrations, docs, tests). The sections
below are an initial structure that will be filled iteratively.

## Upcoming guides

1. **Getting started**: install the binary or the JSR module, configure a project, and run the first
   commands.
2. **Entities & Continuous Coherence**: design entities with `defineEntity`, generate schemas, and
   keep artifacts synchronized.
3. **Templates**: use and customize `templates/app-minimal`.

Each guide will rely on reproducible examples and the Deno tasks described in `deno.jsonc`.
